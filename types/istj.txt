[ISTJ]
Introverted Sensing (Si): The ISTJ is first and foremost a perceiver of concrete information and experiences, seeking to develop a reliable internal
                          framework of their life which they can access in order to make decisions about the present moment.
Extroverted Thinking (Te): Auxiliary Te, combined with dominant Si, makes the ISTJ a methodical and grounded "doer" by providing them with a knack
                           for using external systems to affect change and reach goals in the outside world, backed up by information from Si.
Introverted Feeling (Fi): Tertiary Fi provides the ISTJ with their own sense of what is right and wrong - what they value and what is not important
                          - but their Te function often takes precedence over the emotions and values they aren't comfortable with expressing.
Extroverted Intuition (Ne): Inferior Ne manifests itself in the ISTJ as a general fear of the unknown, novel, and strange, and sometimes makes
                            them closed off to new ideas or ways of thinking.  When stressed, the ISTJ often imagines the worst possible outcomes
                            of the future that they cannot predict or know.
