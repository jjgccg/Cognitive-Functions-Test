[ENTP]
Extroverted Intuition (Ne): The ENTP is captivated by ideas and connections in the external world, stimulated by new information and experiences.						     Combined with auxiliary Ti, the ENTP is an explorer of ideas and is avid about intellectual debate.
Introverted Thinking (Ti): Auxiliary Ti gives ENTPs a logical framework for classifying and working with their ideas.  They seek new information 						   	in order to devise logical structures for the massive amounts of connections their dominant Ne makes.  Development of 							   Ti logic is important to ENTP growth.
Extroverted Feeling (Fe): Auxiliary Fe, concerned with the values and feeling tones of ones surroundings, manifests itself in the ENTP when paired 					         with Ne through expressiveness and eloquence in debate and conversation.
Introverted Sensing (Si): Inferior Si manifests itself in the ENTP through their disposition to gloss over details in favor of the bigger picture.
						  Furthermore, when in a state of stress, ENFPs may get stuck in recollection of bad experiences from the past.
