[ISFP]
Introverted Feeling (Fi): First and foremost, the ISFP seeks to define and develop their own set of unique values, beliefs, and what is important to them.  They strive for meaning, connection, and the integration of their values in their life.
Extroverted Sensing (Se): Extroverted sensing in the ISFP, when working with dominant Fi, seeks to express their values through concrete, sensory experience and accomplishments, which has earned them the nickname of "artists".  Development of Se perception is important to ISFP growth.
Introverted Intuition (Ni): Tertiary Ni manifests itself in the ISFP by providing them with some underlying pattern and meaning in their life and their values.
Extroverted Thinking (Te): Inferior Te manifests itself in the ISFP through a favoring of emotion-driven beliefs over hard, factual logic.  When under stress, the ISFP may become uncharacteristically blunt and controlling of their environment.
