[ENFJ]
Extroverted Feeling (Fe): The ENFJ leads with Fe, whose primary concern is understanding and working with values and feeling tones in the external 						     environment.  In the ENFJ, Fe seeks to gently lead and counsel others around them.
Introverted Intuition (Ni): Auxiliary Ni in the ENFJ provides a source of creativity and insight which gives the ENFJ an intuitive vision of how 							 they need to affect the outside world through their dominant Fe.  Development of Ni insight is important to ENFJ 								    growth.
Extroverted Sensing (Se): Tertiary Se gives the ENFJ a decent knack for groundedness and control in their external environment, and provides the 						   raw factual information necessary for their Ni to process.
Introverted Thinking (Ti): Inferior Ti manifests itself in the ENFJ as a general disposition to value feeling and intuition over cold, hard logic.   						 When stressed, the ENFJ may go into a state of cold paralysis while trying to logically analyze their issues.
