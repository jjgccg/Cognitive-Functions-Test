[ENTJ]
Extroverted Thinking (Te): The ENTJ is first and foremost concerned with organizing their external environment in order to meet goals.  This makes 							  them task oriented and results-driven individuals who strive for control.
Introverted Intuition (Ni): Auxiliary Ni in the ENTJ provides their dominant function with creativity and vision so they can work towards their 						    ideals with abstract understanding.  Development of Ni insight is important to ENTJ growth.
Extroverted Sensing (Se): Tertiary Se gives the ENFJ a decent knack for groundedness and control in their external environment, and provides the 						   raw factual information necessary for their Ni to process.
Introverted Feeling (Fi): Inferior Fi manifests itself in the ENTJ as a placing of much higher priority to logic and goals over personal values 						  and emotions.  During stress, the ENTJ may become uncharacteristically emotional and value-oriented in place of their 						  relentless logic.
